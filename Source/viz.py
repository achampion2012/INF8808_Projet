def add_choro_trace(fig, montreal_data, locations, z_vals, colorscale):
    '''
        Adds the choropleth trace, representing Montreal's neighborhoods.

        Note: The z values and colorscale provided ensure every neighborhood
        will be grey in color. Although the trace is defined using Plotly's
        choropleth features, we are simply defining our base map.

        Args:
            fig: The figure to add the choropleth trace to
            montreal_data: The data used for the trace
            locations: The locations (neighborhoods) to show on the trace
            z_vals: The table to use for the choropleth's z values
            colorscale: The table to use for the choropleth's color scale
        Returns:
            fig: The updated figure with the choropleth trace

def add_scatter_traces(fig, df):
    '''
        Adds the scatter trace, representing Montreal's pedestrian paths.

        Args:
            fig: The figure to add the scatter trace to
            df: The dataframe containing the information on the
                pedestrian paths to display
        Returns:
            The figure now containing the scatter trace
